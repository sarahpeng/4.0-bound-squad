# Project Brainstorm: Human Children

**Domain of Interest**

Children are a large portion of our world population. Our interest and field of domain is focused on Human Children. Within this domain, there are a variety of measurements that leaves us open space to do research. 

Examples of data driven project we found related to this domain are:
* The birth rates and fertility datasets that surround children.
* The names used for children.
* The amount spent on children within an age range.
* Top diseases children have.

The data-driven questions we hope to answer about this domain are:
* What diseases do children have in relation to their income?
* Where are children located for high and low child murder rates?
* What gender of children tend to die most?

**Finding Data**

We downloaded the data from [DATA.GOV](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?tags=murder)

* The first dataset was from [NCHS - Infant Mortality Rates, by Race: United States, 1915-2013](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-infant-mortality-rates-by-race-united-states-1915-2013). The data was collected by the National Center for Health Statistics, CDC. The data was about infant mortality rates by race rom 1915-2013.There are 198 observations (rows) and 3 features (columns). A question that can be answered by this dataset is: "What race has the highest child mortality rates?"

* The second dataset was from []
