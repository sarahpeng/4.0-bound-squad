# Project Brainstorm: Human Children

**Domain of Interest**

Children are a large portion of our world population. Our interest and field of domain is focused on Human Children. Within this domain, there are a variety of measurements that leaves us open space to do research.

Examples of data driven project we found related to this domain are:
* The birth rates and fertility datasets that surround children.
* The names used for children.
* The amount spent on children within an age range.
* Top diseases children have.

The data-driven questions we hope to answer about this domain are:
* What diseases do children have in relation to their income?
* Where are children located for high and low child murder rates?
* What gender of children tend to die most?

**Finding Data**

We downloaded the data from [DATA.GOV](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?tags=murder)

* The first dataset was from [NCHS - Infant Mortality Rates, by Race: United States, 1915-2013](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-infant-mortality-rates-by-race-united-states-1915-2013). The data was collected by the National Center for Health Statistics, CDC. The data was about infant mortality rates by race rom 1915-2013.There are 198 observations (rows) and 3 features (columns). A question that can be answered by this dataset is: "What race has the highest child mortality rates?"

* The second dataset was from [California Department of Public Health](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/immunizations-in-child-care-by-academic-year-22e19). The data was collected by the California Department of Public Health, last updated in 2017. This dataset contains immunization status of child care facility enrollees aged 2 years to 4 years 11 months in California in facilities with 10 or more children enrolled. There are 65535 observations (rows) and 14 features (columns). A question that can be answered by this dataset is: "How many schools are categorized as “UP-TO-DATE” on their immunizations?"

* The third dataset was from [Maryland state Opendata government site](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/child-maltreatment-rate-2010-2016). The dataset was contained from Maryland state Opendata government site at opendata.maryland.gov This indicator shows the rate of children who are maltreated per 1,000 population under the age of 18. Child abuse or neglect can result in physical harm, developmental delays, behavioral problems, or death. There are 201 observations (rows) and 5 features (columns). A question that can be answered by this dataset is: "Which county had the most child maltreatment in relation to the northern and southern sides of the Maryland state?"
